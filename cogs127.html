            This user flow demonstrates one method of implementing microsavings
            by rounding up on specific individual purchases. This gives the user
            more control over which transactions to round or not. Users such as
            Greg, who may not be able to contribute a set amount from month to month,
            can then pick and choose which transactions to round up. Furthermore,
            in order to streamline the process of rounding individual transactions,
            there are simplified options and no confusing changing of settings.
            The simple yes/no choices are easy to understand even for users such as
            Craig who are not tech savvy and might have trouble accessing and changing
            things in the settings menu

          <p>
            This user flow demonstrates a method by which Sarah can manage interest
            from her loans more concretely. She begins by selecting the account which
            contains the balance she wants to keep track of, bringing up a screen
            showing her current balance along with what that balance will be at in
            (some point in time; maybe a year? 3 years?) if she were to keep on
            paying the minimum balance. Sarah decides that she wants to pay more
            than the minimum, so she elects to change up the amount she is paying
            per month. After seeing the change in how much she needs to pay over time,
            Sarah is satisfied, and applies this change to her current budget.
            By doing this, Sarah is able to more easily remain cognizant of the amount
            that she has save up for in order to reduce debt, making it easier for her
            to make larger purchases in the future.

          <p>
            Our team learned that making UI Sketches (paper prototyping) is very
            tedious and long, but it allows us to connect our UX Flow sheets to our
            sketches through the step by step process when using the application.
            Paper prototyping also allows for making multiple iterations of layouts,
            and oftentimes we would come up with new, better ideas while in the midst
            of sketching our intital idea. We wanted to add the rounding setting so
            that the application automatically rounded up when categorizing the transactions,
            and our paper prototypes explored placing that feature directly into the
            transactions screen as well as having it as a toggled setting.
            Our sketches took from Acorn’s round up feature and altered it to save
            the money rather than invest that money so the user can use it to fund
            anything else they might need, as well as Digit’s savings account feature
            for the interest payoff plans. We also borrowed inspiration from popular
            apps such as Tinder that use a more intuitive left/right swiping motion
            to access screens instead of having users have to go through multiple decision-making screens.

      <div class="row justify-content-md-center">

          <p class="text-center">Paper Prototype A Images</p>
          <p>
            Our design for our first prototype `is based off of the first UX flow,
            which allows users to “save their digital change” by rounding up on
            transactions and placing these small amounts of money into a savings account.
            The idea behind it is that as the user spends money, they also simultaneously
            have an easy method of saving. In A2 we also explored the idea of automatic savings,
            but a) many banks already offer this and it would be redundant to replicate it on a
            mobile app since it is a one time action as well as b) not all users have a fixed
            monthly income and might want to save a variable amount each month.
            Thus, in order to make saving as painless a process as possible when having to
            enter savings manually, rounding up on individual purchases allows enough
            flexibility in saving amounts while still being easily accessible.
            Similarly, the swiping mechanism to round up transactions minimizes the
            number of steps one needs to take.
            Users need as little as two or at most three swipes/taps to immediately
            put money into their savings.

          <p class="text-center">Paper Prototype B Images</p>
          <p>
            We designed our second prototype based off of our second UX flow to
            allow users to edit how much they want to pay off their debt
            (in this case, their credit card debt). We kept the idea of changing
            the amount they want to pay off each month with the goal of paying off
            their card in a certain amount of time. Instead of adding more buttons
            to press when showing their budget over time, we used a modal to show
            how long it would take to pay off their debt as they change their
            monthly payment. This way, users get an idea of how much they need to
            save so they can pay off their debt.
            The differences in our prototypes was the type of interaction the user
            had with the application. With Prototype A, the user was more focused
            on saving money by rounding their spent money so that the app puts away
            a certain amount every time they spend. With Prototype B, the user is
            more focused on paying back spent money (debt) so that they are aware
            of how much they need to pay and set a schedule for payments.

            We tested our prototypes on three UCSD students. For each of the three,
            they began by being debriefed about the overall type of app we are using
            and were then given a brief overview of the task they were supposed to
            complete: for the microsavings prototype, they were instructed to choose
            a purchase and round up three dollars on a purchase, and for the interest
            payoff prototype, they were instructed to change the minimum payment on
            their credit card. After running through both prototypes, each user was
            asked what their biggest issue was and which prototype they preferred.
            Each user managed to complete these tasks with little outside assistance
            aside from one portion of the second prototype.

          <p>
            This is our original design that follows the paper prototype we created
            that implemented one of our original UX flows. We decided to proceed with
            this prototype over the other after conducting three interviews in which
            users tested out two different UX flows, and all three users prefered the
            experience of the prototype we implemented over the other one.
            Here, we utilize arrows as signifiers to make the user swipe to the right,
            opening up a new menu that would allow for them to round up a purchase.
            We believe that by having the arrows pointing to the right, a user would
            attempt to swipe to the right. After a purchase is rounded, we then remove
            the arrow by that transaction, helping the user remember the transactions
            they’ve rounded already

          <p class="text-center">Alternative Screen Images</p>
          <p>
            We decided to create another whole flow that will act as our alternate
            screens because we felt that we should have a different action that
            brings us to the desired event while still following the flow of our
            paper prototype. Additionally, this design is more akin to the original
            Mint app as the android version has a hold down function while the IOS
            version does not. These screens are testing a different type of user
            interaction to get to the rounding (holding down versus swiping). We
            believe that holding down is another common action many mobile users
            perform and is quite intuitive because the transaction component will
            become highlighted onced the user touches that component.

          <p class="text-center">Prototype Flows and before-after Images</p>
          <p>
            Based on user feedback from our friends and classmates, we decided to use the
            tap-and-hold interaction over the swiping interaction to implement the
            rounding up feature. This is mainly because with the tapping feature,
            the transaction remains visible for more of the rounding process so
            that the user remains well informed about which transaction they are
            rounding on. With the swiping action, the transaction is hidden and
            if a user wants to double check which transaction they are rounding
            on they must cancel the entire process to view the transaction again.
            Holding down on a touch target is also a more purposeful action that
            prevents users from accidentally rounding transactions through careless
            handling of their phone. Although swiping is the quicker and more intuitive
            action, it also leaves more room for error and for users to accidentally
            swipe on the wrong thing. Swiping works well for more low-stakes apps
            such as Tinder, but with an app like Mint that deals with money, users
            may prefer an interaction that is slower but more precise.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also made a few logistical changes to the wording of the dialog on
            the feature. Rather than having the text read “Round Up By”, we switched
            it to “Round Up To”,  which saves the user from having to do mental math
            to add together the transaction and the change. Instead, the user can
            think of the total value that the transaction has been rounded to as the
            new value of the transaction. In order to help the user see how much they
            are saving on each rounding action and save them the trouble of calculating
            it, we kept the ending notification dialog as “$___ has been added to your
            savings account!” in order to inform the user on not only the total rounded
            value but also the amount being saved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we changed the numerical values of the rounding feature, based
            on user feedback that rounding by multiples of change felt too small and
            that they would like the option to save faster by rounding higher.
            Thus, instead of rounding to the nearest dollar and having multiples of
            that number, we chose to have options rounding to the nearest 50 cents,
            the nearest dollar, and for larger transactions, to the nearest $10 or
            even nearest $100. This allows the user to save in increments as small
            or large as they want, and can also slightly tailor the app to users in
            different financial situations. A user that often makes large purchases
            that costs $50 or $100 will probably want to save larger amounts since
            they have the means to spend larger amounts, while maybe a college student
            that only makes purchases under $20 would like to save smaller amounts since
            they do not have as much income to set aside into savings.
