            I was a part of a team that researched and designed a new feature
            for the banking application, Mint. Mint is an application that
            connects to your bank account and provides a variety of ways to
            budget money. Our goal was to create an even more efficient way
            to motivate users to actually save money.

            and high-fidelity prototyping.

            Many young adults are constantly facing new financial problems
            whether it be paying off rent, car insurance, or even
            in personal entertainment. In doing so, many have trouble finding efficient
            ways to save money and are often scared away from saving in the first
            place because the entire process of budgeting and saving money can be overwhelming.

            The research we conducted aimed to identify the main banking applications

            to save money.

            With that understanding, we set off to interview potential users.

          <p>Users sometimes have difficulty using applications because of the

            Users typically go onto these applications to check or visualize their
            spending habits rather than to set goals and follow certain criteria.
            It’s a much more loose way of saving up money.

            Our design for our prototype allows users to “save their digital change” by rounding up on
            transactions and placing these small amounts of money into a savings account.
            We explored the idea of automatic savings, however.
            <li>many banks already offer this and it would be redundant to replicate it on a
                mobile app since it is a one time action as well as</li>
            <li>not all users have a fixed
            monthly income and might want to save a variable amount each month.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, in order to make saving as painless a process as possible when having to
            enter savings manually, rounding up on individual purchases allows enough
            flexibility in saving amounts while still being easily accessible.

            Based on user feedback from our friends and classmates, we decided to use the
            tap-and-hold interaction over the swiping interaction to implement the
            rounding up feature. Holding down on a touch target is also a more
            purposeful action that prevents users from accidentally rounding
            transactions through careless handling of their phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we changed the numerical values of the rounding feature, based
            on user feedback that rounding by multiples of change felt too small and
            that they would like the option to save faster by rounding higher.
            Thus, instead of rounding to the nearest dollar and having multiples of
            that number, we chose to have options rounding to the nearest 50 cents,
            the nearest dollar, and for larger transactions, to the nearest $10 or
            even nearest $100.

            This case study provided great insight on current applications in the market.
            It's interesting to see how, with the right research and design foundations,
            we can potentially improve current applications that already feel complete.

            I feel that our idea is more of a stepping stone rather than a replacemnet.
            It's simplicity and efficiency should motivate new users to actually
            start saving money and eventually branch out to other money saving features
            that are more complex.

            Our goal was to create something that was extremely easy to use so
            that new users won't be intimated or overwhelmed and I believe that
            we succeeded.
