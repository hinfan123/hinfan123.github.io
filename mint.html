          I researched and designed a new feature for the banking application,
          Mint. Mint is a mobile application that connects to your bank account and
          provides a variety of ways to help budget money. The goal was to implement
          a more intuitive way to save money that allows new users to stay motivated
          to save money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, my main focuses were research, finding user needs,
          creating UX Flows, paper prototyping, and high-fidelity prototyping.

          Many young adults are constantly facing new financial problems
          whether it be paying off debt, car insurance, or even
          paying off a house. In doing so, many have trouble finding efficient
          ways to save money and are often scared away from saving in the first
          place because the entire process of budgeting and saving money can be overwhelming.

          The research we conducted aimed to identify the main banking applications
          people used, the reason why use those applications, and the techniques practiced
          to save money.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that understanding, we set off to interview potential users.
          We asked these two questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          1) What do you currently use to budget your money? <br>
          2) How do you keep track of your money through those applications?

          “For the most part, I usually keep track of everything I spend through

        <p><b>Key Takeaway</b></p>
        <p>Users sometimes have difficulty using applications because of the
          barrier to entry and the amount of work added onto everyday management
          can be time consuming.

          “I don’t really use it to save money, it’s more for keeping track of

        </p>
        <p><b>Key Takeaway</b></p>
        <p>
          Users typically go onto these applications to check or visualize their
          spending habits rather than to set goals and follow certain criteria.
          It’s a much more loose way of saving up money.

        <p>
          Our design for our prototype allows users to “save their digital change” by rounding up on
          transactions and placing these small amounts of money into a savings account.
        </p>
        <p>
          We explored the idea of automatic savings, but many banks already offer
          this and it would be redundant to replicate it on a mobile app since
          it is a one time action not all users have a fixed monthly income and
          might want to save a variable amount each month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, in order to make saving as painless a process as possible when having to
          enter savings manually, rounding up on individual purchases allows enough
          flexibility in saving amounts while still being easily accessible.

          This is our original design that follows the paper prototype we created
          that implemented our original UX flow. Here, we utilize arrows as signifiers
          to make the user swipe to the right, opening up a new menu that would allow
          for them to round up a purchase.

          We went with a different action to indicate the new savings features.

          the amount they want to save.

        <p>
          Based on user feedback from our friends and classmates, we decided to use the
          tap-and-hold interaction over the swiping interaction to implement the
          rounding up feature. Holding down on a touch target is also a more
          purposeful action that prevents users from accidentally rounding
          transactions through careless handling of their phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we changed the numerical values of the rounding feature, based
          on user feedback that rounding by multiples of change felt too small and
          that they would like the option to save faster by rounding higher.
          Thus, instead of rounding to the nearest dollar and having multiples of
          that number, we chose to have options rounding to the nearest 50 cents,
          the nearest dollar, and for larger transactions, to the nearest $10 or
          even nearest $100.

          This case study provided great insight on current applications in the market.
          It's interesting to see how, with the right research and design foundations,
          we can potentially improve current applications that already feel complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel that our idea is more of a stepping stone rather than a replacemnet.
          It's simplicity and efficiency should motivate new users to actually
          start saving money and eventually branch out to other money saving features
          that are more complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal was to create something that was extremely easy to use so
          that new users won't be intimated or overwhelmed and I believe that
          we succeeded.
