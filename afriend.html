            It’s ironic how it’s more difficult to find friends in today’s day and
            age when we are historically more connected then we have ever been.
            AFriend was created as a social computing system to explore how might we
            leverage geolocation and anonymity to create an opportunity for strangers
            to become AFriend to each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            We primarily prototyped AFriend at UC San Diego using our library
            as a hotspot to have data-driven designs.

            We conducted online surveys and in person interviews to try and get
            a better sense of how people use social media. We then asked about
            the impact of anonymity online and coupled it with our data.
            One of the interviewees asked “How long would it take for people to
            go the next step and introduce each other, and what would the possibilty
            be of actually meeting in person". We chose to make those questions
            our main points of focus.

            From our interviews and surveys, we found that
            6/10 users do not take online interactions too
            seriously and that the anonymity aspect addresses the fear of social
            reprecussions so people could unapologetically be themselves for the
            good and the bad.

            starting off anonymous and then revealing themselves if their online interactions went well.</p>

            We used the concept of a localized chat based on your location.
            We then wanted to match users with each others based on
            common interests. A user would join a local chat room and see the list
            of everyone in that area and their match rating compared to other's
            next to their "names".
          </p>
          <p>
            We planned to then implement a “wave” feature to notify other's that
            someone would like to chat with them privately. Another feature would
            be to "roll the dice" and get paired wtih a random person that has a high
            match rating with yours.

            We used discord to represent the online messaging features of our
            prototype and we discovered that the features discord already has would mesh
            well with what the final product of our application would hold.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, since we didn't moderate the chats carefully enough, content
            that people could find offensive did slip into the conversations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to this, we noticed that the audience did not move around
            to change rooms, so future iterations might include things that incentivize
            moving from one location to another.

            Using geolocation allows users to interact with each other while
            they are in the same place at the same time.
          <p>
          <p>
            Messaging is difficult to manage as moderating group chats requires a
            lot of work and if not moderated well, can scare off potential users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best use cases to pivot towards would be for users to use this
            application during class to help each other with notes or get class updates.
            They can then create study groups based off who they enjoyed talking to.
