# hinfan123.github.io

This is my personal website that I decided to host through GitHub. 
It will act as my portfolio and display all of the work I have done throughout the years.

## Tools

The styling framework that I used was [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/).
I added some javascript libraries to add some animations to the [landing page](https://ityped.surge.sh/) as well as [scrolling effects](https://scrollrevealjs.org/).
